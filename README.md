# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game! This is a simple browser-based game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It's a great beginner-friendly project to learn and practice JavaScript skills.

## 🎮 How to Play
- Use the **Arrow Keys** to control the direction of the snake:
  - **Up Arrow**: Move Up
  - **Down Arrow**: Move Down
  - **Left Arrow**: Move Left
  - **Right Arrow**: Move Right
- The objective is to eat the red food squares to grow your snake.
- Avoid running into the edges of the screen or your own body, or the game will end.

## 🚀 Features
- Dynamic game canvas
- Responsive snake movement
- Randomly generated food positions
- Collision detection for game-over scenarios

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML**: To set up the canvas element for the game.
- **CSS**: For basic styling of the canvas.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic, including rendering, movement, collision detection, and user controls.

# 💻 How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Play and enjoy!

## 📖 How It Works
1. The **snake** and **food** are drawn on a grid inside the canvas.
2. The snake moves in the chosen direction every 150ms.
3. When the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the food reappears at a random position.
4. The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.

## ✨ Future Improvements
- Increase game speed as the snake grows longer.
- Add obstacles to make the game more challenging.

## 🌟 Acknowledgments
